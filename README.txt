RapidPortal is a currently unannounced but very fast moving (i.e expect completion in 48 hours) jab 
at making an sMAP infrastructure control portal.

The idea is, we are going to have multiple drivers made by multiple people. Some of these people may 
have no idea about how to set up a server, and many of the things being controlled can be done
remotely (i.e we are just federating existing APIs). Why not have a platform for simply deploying
drivers?

In the short term, this is more about making it easy to deploy a given branch or commit in
such a way that it won't bother anyone else if the code is shoddy and crashes all the time, yet is
still available to everyone and is still based off the central repo.
